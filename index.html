Despite facing natural disasters, poverty, and other obstacles, its people have shown incredible resilience, courage, and innovation. I have always believed that if we can unleash the potential of even the poorest individual, we can change the future of our nation. The strength of Bangladesh lies not in its wealth or resources but in its people, their dreams, and their determination to succeed."
